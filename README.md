# APPLICATION-FOR-INTERNSHIP

I came across your post regarding the R&D Engineering Team internship at Synopsys (Noida) and Iâ€™m very interested in applying.

I am a final-year B.Tech (ECE) student at NMAM Institute of Technology (2025 batch) with a strong foundation in C, Verilog, SystemVerilog, UVM, Digital Design, and Linux basics. My academic project, Automatic Debris Hunting System, involved programming in C and implementing debris tracking using machine learning, where I contributed extensively to the embedded systems development.

Currently, I am pursuing a Design Verification Internship where I have worked on verifying SPI and UART protocols using SystemVerilog, and I am actively enhancing my skills in UVM methodology. Additionally, my Mario-inspired FSM project helped strengthen my Verilog design skills and deepened my understanding of hardware modeling.
